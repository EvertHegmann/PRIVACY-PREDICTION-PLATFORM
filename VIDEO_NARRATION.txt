PRIVACY PREDICTION PLATFORM - 1-MINUTE VIDEO NARRATION
(Spoken Content Only)

========================================

Introducing the Privacy Prediction Platform, a comprehensive FHEVM Example Hub submission for the Zama Bounty Track December 2025.

This project demonstrates a complete, production-ready solution for building privacy-preserving smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology.

The repository contains a complete project structure: Two smart contracts, over 110 test cases, two TypeScript-based automation scripts, and auto-generated GitBook documentation.

The first contract, PrivacyGuess.sol, implements a basic commit-reveal encryption scheme for confidential predictions. Users can create prediction events, make encrypted predictions, and later reveal their guesses with cryptographic verification.

The second contract, PrivacyGuessFHESimple.sol, extends this with advanced features including multi-round prediction support, emergency pause and resume functionality, and efficient batch operations.

All code is thoroughly tested with over fifty test cases for the basic implementation and sixty test cases for the advanced version. Tests cover both successful operations and common pitfalls, demonstrating best practices for FHEVM development.

The project includes two powerful automation tools. The first generates complete standalone FHEVM example repositories with a single command. It clones the Hardhat template, injects your contracts and tests, and auto-generates deployment scripts and configuration files.

The second automation tool generates professional GitBook-compatible documentation directly from your code. It extracts contracts and tests, formats them with syntax highlighting, organizes examples by category, and maintains a central table of contents.

The implementation demonstrates five key FHEVM patterns: Commit-reveal encryption for confidential commitments, event lifecycle management for complex workflows, access control for authorization, multi-round support for advanced use cases, and batch operations for gas efficiency.

This submission meets all Zama Bounty requirements. It uses Hardhat for all examples, includes automated scaffolding and documentation generation, provides comprehensive test coverage, and offers production-ready smart contract patterns.

Additionally, the project includes bonus implementations: creative real-world use cases, advanced patterns like multi-round predictions, clean and maintainable automation scripts, comprehensive developer documentation, extensive test coverage, complete error handling and pitfall documentation, and maintenance tools for future updates.

All code is fully documented, production-tested, and ready for developers to learn from or integrate into their own FHEVM projects.

The Privacy Prediction Platform represents a complete solution for building the FHEVM Example Hub, combining working smart contracts, automated tools, comprehensive tests, and professional documentation.

This submission is available on GitHub at EvertHegmann/PrivacyPredictionPlatform, with a live demo at privacy-prediction-platform.vercel.app.

Built with passion for the Zama Bounty Track December 2025, advancing privacy-preserving blockchain technology through Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

Thank you for reviewing the Privacy Prediction Platform.
